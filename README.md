### Project 1: [Employee Onboarding Form](https://github.com/usama-370/Power-Apps-and-Power-Automate/blob/main/README.md)

I developed an Employee Onboarding Form using Power Apps to streamline the onboarding process by automating data collection and improving accuracy and efficiency. The form integrates with Dataverse in a sandbox environment, ensuring seamless data management.

**Key Features:**
- **Form Design:** Includes fields like First Name, Last Name, Job Title, Department (dropdown), Manager (auto-populated from Active Directory), and more.
- **Interactive Elements:** Users can manually add new departments, and dropdown selections trigger auto-fill functions for managers' information.
- **Validations:** Ensures correct format for names, emails, phone numbers, and dates.
- **Automation:** Power Automate sends automated email notifications upon form submission.
- **Benefits:** Enhances efficiency, minimizes errors, and integrates with existing databases.

This solution significantly improves the onboarding process by saving time and reducing manual tasks for HR and managers.
